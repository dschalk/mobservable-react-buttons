The included index.html file is ready to go. Just load it into a browser as a file or with a web server.
If you modify the code, you will need to run the following code from your terminal:

```javascript
npm install
webpack
```
"npm install" installs a "node_modules" directory. After that, all you need to run is "webpack". Webpack loads everything you need into a file named "bundle.js" which is installed in "index.html". After that, you are good to go. 

A development server is included in this repository, so you can view the buttons on port 8080 by entering:

```javascript
webpack-dev-server
```
Commentary is included with the running app. You can see the buttons in action in a larger site at [Gane if Scire](http://machinegun.ninja).
