##Reactive rollover buttons. 

Focus and hover highlighting is coordinated among buttons. Additionally, the buttons coordinate with text input. If you enter the name of one of the four buttons, it lights up. If you enter some other text, the buttons all go dim but the display button shows the current choice (the entered text), as always.

This demonstration is a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) application. The buttons are made responsive by [Mobservable](https://github.com/mweststrate/mobservable).
